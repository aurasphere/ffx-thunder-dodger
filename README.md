Application for automatically dodging thunders in FFX's Thunder Plains (HD remaster for PS4).

## Usage
1. Install [PS4 remote play](https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/it/index.html)
2. Connect your PS4 through remote play and open the game
3. Go to the Thunder Plains
4. Launch this script by running from command line: 

       java -jar ffx-thunder-dodger-1.0.0.jar

5. Switch focus to the window game
6. Move around in the plain. The lightning will be dodged automatically!

<b> Note: </b> if the script doesn't work, it's most likely due to a slow network. In this case, you can try to disconnect other devices from your LAN. Otherwise, feel free to open an issue!
